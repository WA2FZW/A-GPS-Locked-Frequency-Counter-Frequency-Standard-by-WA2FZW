# A-GPS-Locked-Frequency-Counter-Frequency-Standard-by-WA2FZW

This project is a GPS locked combination frequency counter/frequency standard.

It's designed to work with the QRP Labs QLG1 GPS Kit. It runs on an Arduino
Nano and uses a 4x20 LCD display. An Si5351 module is used as the frequency
standard.

Included is the software for the "GPS_Counter" program, a document that
describes how to build and operate it and the Gerber files for the printed
circuit board.

A second program, "Where_MI" can be run on the same hardware and provides
traditional GPS functionality.

Enjoy!
